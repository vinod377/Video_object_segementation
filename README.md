# Video_object_segementation
### Video Object Segmentation using One short Deep Learning. The Repository is implementation of the paper[](). OSVS is a CNN architecture to tackle the problem of semi-supervised video object segmentation, It basically consist of two stages. 
- Parent network training: Which produces a rough forground/Backround segmentation
- Fine tunning: The trained model is finetuned for specfic object/mask_ground truth pair for n number of epoch on sigle or few initial  frames of Video.(Hence called One shot learning).
